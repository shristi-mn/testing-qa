**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed failure to attempt reconnection (when JERQ drops connection before inbound control messages are processed).

**Other**

* Fixed login screen of single-page example application. The login screen no longer remains locked after failure (e.g. bad password).
* Corrected unit tests for some symbol conversions (where the output changes based on the current year).
* Added additional debug-level logging for inbound JERQ control messages.
* Added documentation, explicitly stating that reconnect attempts will continue until `Connection.disconnect` is invoked.
