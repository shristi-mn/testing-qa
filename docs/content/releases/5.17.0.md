**New Features**

* Added support for OHLC messages (DDF record=2 and subrecord=6). These message were previously ignored. Now, when an OHLC message is received, the `Quote` object will be updated and the `MarketUpdateCallback` will be triggered.

**Other**

* Replaced several instances of the JavaScript [equality operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Equality) with the [strict equality operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Strict_equality).
