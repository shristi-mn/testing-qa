**New Features**

* Added `Quote.priceChange` and `Quote.priceChangePercent` properties. The values of these properties are derived. The derivation logic preserves figures from the previous trading day until a trade occurs in the current trading day.

**Bug Fixes**

* Updated the DDF message parser to read the _previousPrice_ value from the _previous_ session during pre-market hours.

**Other**

* Removed some undocumented features.
