**Features from the deprecated [@barchart/marketdata-utilities-js](https://github.com/barchart/marketdata-utilities-js) library have been incorporated here. As a result, several breaking changes have been introduced.**

* Many objects and functions have been renamed or moved.
  * The ```Connection``` class was moved.
* The library now includes features from @barchart/marketdata-utilities-js.
  * Utilities have been placed in the ```/lib/utilities```folder.
  * Utilities are now exported as pure functions -- with no object wrappers.
* All ```index.js``` files were removed -- explicit imports are now required.
* Bower is no longer supported -- the ```bower.json```file was removed.
