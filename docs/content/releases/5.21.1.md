**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed issue which triggered the level one market data callback when a cumulative volume update was processed. In other words, the [`MarketUpdateCallback`](https://docs.barchart.com/marketdata-api-js/#/content/sdk/lib-connection?id=callbacksmarketupdatecallback) subscription handler (passed to the [`Connection.on`](https://docs.barchart.com/marketdata-api-js/#/content/sdk/lib-connection?id=connectionon) function) will no longer receive `REFRESH_CUMULATIVE_VOLUME` messages.
