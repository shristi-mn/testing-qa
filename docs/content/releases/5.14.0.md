**New Features**

* In some cases, the default price formatting rules (based on the `UnitCode` class) need to be tweaked. In a prior version, we added the `Profile.setPriceFormatterCustom` function which allows the consumer to specify their own price-formatting delegate. This version adds an implementation of that delegate that is intended for use with the [cmdtyView](https://www.barchart.com/cmdty/trading/cmdtyview) product.
