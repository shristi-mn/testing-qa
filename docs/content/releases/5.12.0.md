**New Features**

* Added the `AssetClass` enumeration to describe instrument types (e.g. stocks, futures, options, etc).
* Added the `Profile.asset` property which references an `AssetClass` item, assuming the asset class can be inferred from the instrument's symbol. 
* Added the `Profile.setPriceFormatterCustom` function which allows the consumer to specify their own price format function, completely overriding the default price formatting logic.
