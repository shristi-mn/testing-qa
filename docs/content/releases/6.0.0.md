**Breaking Changes**

* Eliminated some third-party dependencies. As a consequence, Node.js environments must now pass an instance of `EnvironmentForNode` to the `Connection` constructor. Alternately, an instance of `XmlParserFactoryForNode` may be passed to the `Connection.connect` function.
* Changed the signature of the `utilities/parse/ddf/message` function. It is unlikely that SDK consumers call this function directly. However, if this function is used, an `XmlParser` instance must now me passed the to function.

**Technical Enhancements**

* The [`moment`](https://momentjs.com/) dependency has been eliminated after explicitly updating the [@barchart/common-js](https://github.com/barchart/common-node-js) library.
* The [`@xmldom/xmldom`](https://github.com/xmldom/xmldom) dependency is now only used when operating in Node.js. Consequently, tree-shaking tools may now exclude this dependency.
